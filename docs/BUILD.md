# Building and Installing ND-Research

## Installation

Using [CMake](https://cmake.org), the following commands can be run to install the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crdrisko/nd-research.git
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../nd-research/.
make && [sudo] make install
```

By default, the project is installed in the `/usr/local` filesystem but can be changed with the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option.

## Testing

With each module in the project (ChargedRNEMD, ShiftXYZ, etc.), I have strived to provide ~100% unit test coverage for all functions. These tests can be found in the [`root/nd-research/test`](https://github.com/crdrisko/cpp-units/tree/master/nd-research/test) directory but do not get built by default. To turn on the testing features of the repository, add the `nd-research_build_tests` flag to the CMake instructions as shown in the code below.

```bash
## Same steps as before ...
cmake ../nd-research/. -Dnd-research_build_tests=ON
make && [sudo] make install

## Testing occurs in a separate, dedicated directory
cd nd-research/test
ctest --output-on-failure
cd ../../
```

[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), which is used as the unit test framework, will be downloaded and configured as an external CMake project if the repository was not already found. The same is true for the [Utilities-API](https://github.com/crdrisko/utilities-api) and [CPP-Units](https://github.com/crdrisko/cpp-units) projects.
